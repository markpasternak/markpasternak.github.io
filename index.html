                    have maintained an unwavering focus on the customer and working backwards from the core problems we
                    aim to solve.</p>
                <p>As a results-oriented technology executive with extensive experience building and leading engineering
                    organizations, I consistently align technical initiatives closely with business objectives, drive
                    operational effectiveness, and enable sustainable growth by creating or scaling talented teams.</p>
                <p>My technical leadership style emphasizes ownership, autonomy, and clarity of purpose. I believe
                    lasting outcomes emerge from empowered teams—with a clear understanding of goals, the freedom to
                    engage in meaningful challenges, and a sense of accountability for their results. By fostering a
                    collaborative and inclusive workplace culture rooted in empathy, open communication, and continuous
                    improvement, I enable team members to thrive and consistently deliver impactful results.</p>

                            business objectives with innovative technological advancements, building an
                            customer-focused, high-performing, and accountable engineering organization. Believing great
                            leadership is about providing clear context, effective structures, and enabling platforms, I
                            built an empowering engineering culture with autonomy, ownership, and accountability at its
                            core. This approach consistently delivered outstanding outcomes, innovation, and
                            productivity.</p>
                        <p>I established a strategic technology roadmap aligning innovation, operational stability,

                            with the board, I translated complex technology contexts into impactful strategic insights.
                            Managing a substantial technology budget, I ensured optimal investments for maximum customer
                            value and operational impact.</p>

                        When I was Mark’s CEO at Storytel from August 2021 to February 2022 and later as a board member,
                        I witnessed Mark’s vision help transform our technical strategy. Mark and his teams rebuilt our
                        technology foundation in a time of limited resources while boosting quality and efficiency. Mark
                        takes good care of his people and combined with his background as a great coder it results in a
                        reliable and grounded leadership. I think Mark is a strong candidate for future CTO and tech
                        leadership roles.

                            people feel valued and motivated to do their best work.</p>

                        <p>If you're looking for a leader who can transform systems, empower teams, and inspire an
                            entire organization while maintaining the highest standards of integrity, Mark is that rare

                        vision for what "good" looks like and continually strives for long term excellence.

                        During a time of immense turbulence at Storytel he brought calm, focus, and compassion to an

                        Mark is hands down one of the most inspiring and energizing leaders I’ve ever had the
                        opportunity to work with. His passion, enthusiasm and get-shit-done attitude really makes all
                        the difference. What I think make Mark rather unique is his genuine interest in and ability to
                        truly empower and grow the people around him.

                        I’ve had the privilege of knowing Mark as both a mentor and a source of inspiration. He’s a
                        unique leader who brings creativity, strategic thinking, and an execution-first mindset to
                        everything he does. Mark has the ability to enthuse teams by painting a clear vision and showing
                        the exact path leading them to successful execution. His talent for shifting altitude
                        effortlessly, going between high-level strategy and detailed implementation is truly
                        exceptional. Mark is just about technology; he’s deeply connected to product mechanics and
                        profoundly understands the business landscape he engages in. I would give an arm and a leg to
                        work with the guy again, and so should you.

                            everyone around him. </p>

                        <p>People love working with Mark, because he is genuinely interested in them and helps them
                            raise their game to a higher level. He doesn’t pressure others - instead he inspires them,
                            which is a truly special trait. </p>

                        <p>Another thing that struck me about Mark was how he always asked the right questions. He was
                            never afraid to address the elephant in the room if there was one. On the other hand, he
                            would readily accept a challenge, and push the original idea even further than anyone else
                            deemed possible. </p>

                        he worked with.

                        What struck me was his faith in individuals, and how he worked tirelessly to empower engineers
                        to deliver strong results. He is an individual who breathes energy into an organisation. By
                        continuously linking to great material, he started discussions amongst the engineers ranging
                        from agile and software development processes to front end tooling.

                        <p> I had the pleasure of managing a group of 70+ PMs, engineers, and UXers with Mark and as a
                            product manager myself.</p>
                        <p> I appreciated his keen insistence on making the balance between the different fields of
                            expertise work to the favor of both the end products and the people crafting the products.
                            Mark is a believer in people and in making people work together across hurdles and
                            boundaries. One thing I learned from him is to never name people as resources. People are
                            individuals that can cooperate - resources can not. And that is a view that is both rare and
                            extremely valuable in tech. Healthy and productive teams are what drives great products,
                            creativity, and employee wellbeing. </p>

                        <p>Mark is passionate and full of energy. He goes all in when needed and knows when to give his
                            people space to make their own decisions. He takes responsibilities beyond his position and
                            holds himself accountable for what he commits to. He is a natural leader with a mission and
                            yet, at his core, he is hands down a great guy to hang around with.</p>

                        instrumental in driving both user retention and significant growth.

                        Mark is also an exceptional manager who cultivates a high-performing team by placing immense
                        trust in his people.
                        He has a remarkable ability to surround himself with highly skilled talent and empower
                        individuals to excel. Mark's belief in the team's potential, coupled with his guidance,
                        consistently pushed me to deliver my best work.

                        Furthermore, Mark possesses a keen eye for identifying inefficiencies in tooling and processes.
                        He proactively addresses these issues, optimizing workflows and empowering the team to work more
                        effectively together, both within and outside of tech.

                        His commitment to continuous improvement has been invaluable.

                        without Mark.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout my career spanning over two decades—from programmer to tech lead,
          manager, and executive—I have maintained an unwavering focus on the customer and
          working backwards from the core problems we aim to solve.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a results-oriented technology executive with extensive experience building and
          leading engineering organizations, I consistently align technical initiatives
          closely with business objectives, drive operational effectiveness, and enable
          sustainable growth by creating or scaling talented teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical leadership style emphasizes ownership, autonomy, and clarity of
          purpose. I believe lasting outcomes emerge from empowered teams—with a clear
          understanding of goals, the freedom to engage in meaningful challenges, and a sense
          of accountability for their results. By fostering a collaborative and inclusive
          workplace culture rooted in empathy, open communication, and continuous
          improvement, I enable team members to thrive and consistently deliver impactful
          results.

              When I was Mark’s CEO at Storytel from August 2021 to February 2022
              and later as a board member, I witnessed Mark’s vision help transform
              our technical strategy. Mark and his teams rebuilt our technology foundation
              in a time of limited resources while boosting quality and efficiency. Mark
              takes good care of his people and combined with his background as a great
              coder it results in a reliable and grounded leadership. I think Mark is a
              strong candidate for future CTO and tech leadership roles.

              I had the privilege of working with Mark during his tenure as CTO at
              Storytel, where he set the standard for what exceptional technical
              leadership looks like. Mark's ability to operate effectively at both
              strategic and hands-on levels helped us build an engineering organization
              that could deliver both efficiency and excellence.
            </p>
            <p>
              What sets Mark apart is his combination of technical brilliance and
              human connection. He built an engineering culture founded on trust,
              empowerment, and accountability that enabled teams to innovate boldly and
              deliver remarkable results with fewer resources. With his leadership, we
              transformed our product into a best-in-class application that can compete
              with industry giants.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mark champions the engineering discipline without compromising on
              customer-centricity. He inspires those around him to stand up for their
              beliefs, challenge assumptions, and aim for meaningful outcomes. His
              passionate advocacy for tech excellence made him the voice of our technical
              organization throughout the company.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond his technical vision, Mark's leadership style is defined by his
              authenticity and care for his people. He distributes mandates, backs his

              to do their best work.

              If you're looking for a leader who can transform systems, empower teams,
              and inspire an entire organization while maintaining the highest standards
              of integrity, Mark is that rare find.

              Mark was an absolute joy to work for. He knows what good looks like when it

              Mark is a diplomat, but never compromises on his beliefs: that teams
              need to be cross-functional and set up for flow to continuously ship.
              Working with Mark, I was amazed by his way of gathering different
              perspectives, listening in – and then help people come up with
              win-win solutions. Mark really made a difference for me and my team.

              I worked closely with Mark during our time at Schibsted as he was one
              of my key stakeholders. Mark is a strong visionary and communicator
              that can convince and inspire the toughest and most skeptical people
              and teams. He is very passionate as a person and has an energetic
              persona which is contagious among the people he work with. He is
              curious and eager to learn and is always up to speed on the latest
              leadership trends, which he happily implement in his manager toolbox.
              He also has the right amount of tech savviness to earn the trust and
              respect of the most senior of engineers.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a joy working with him, not only is he a great guy, but also
              has great core values when it comes to hiring the right people and
              building strong teams. All this make Mark not only a great manager,
              but a leader that engineers follow.

              Enthusiastic, energetic, inspiring and highly knowledgeable, Mark is a
              force for positive change in any software engineering organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've had the good fortune of working with Mark for about a year
              during which he managed a number of teams in the engineering org I was
              responsible for. Despite fairly challenging circumstances, Mark had a
              tremendously positive impact on both his teams and larger organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mark has a long list of great leadership traits (just read the rest
              of the recommendations), but one thing that I find particularly
              inspiring is his ability to identify great ideas and initiatives from
              people around him, elevating and empowering those individuals and
              teams to achieve more than they thought possible. This is an immensely
              powerful skill, creating a positive spiral of confidence and motivation
              through achievements in teams Mark leads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mark would be a true asset in an engineering leadership position for
              any company lucky enough to have him!

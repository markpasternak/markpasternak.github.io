                        Count yourself lucky if you ever get the chance to have Mark as your manager. He's a passionate and very supportive leader... cares deeply about his direct reports, peers and evolving the organisation... manages to strike the balance between having trust... and still providing context and direction... His presence in meetings and presentations is inspiring. A true leader who can lift any organisation.
